# CMPE_255_Assignment_4

This assignment had 3 parts in it with varying weightage of it. Colab files are in the repo itself.
Task 1:
Assignment 1 was to do a complete dataset EDA in colab, the professor had suggested that we use D3.js visualizations but in my case I was not able to import and install it. I seeked help of GPT, cluade.ai, Bard but was unable to find a way around. So, I used matplotlib and seaborn library in my colab file to work around the EDA and create better visualizations. I used housing price predictions datasets which can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QaLF5_B6BumIA5jkedxecJNpJZUvhm7A?usp=sharing.

Task 2: 
Assignment 2 was to do auto EDA with our favorite tool and I chose sweetviz. The dataset was the same as I used in assignment 1. The report genereated by sweetviz is in the file named 'sweetviz_report.html' at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QaLF5_B6BumIA5jkedxecJNpJZUvhm7A?usp=sharing.

Task 3:
Assignment 3 was to demonstrate apache beam features in a colab including composite transform, pipeline io, triggers, windowing ,pardo. I used a different dataset here which can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zFiB7JS1VabyJQw0c-h4747HdbHsQLt3?usp=sharing.
